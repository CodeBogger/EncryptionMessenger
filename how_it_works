all clients connect to relay server
each client has its own unique individual socket
relays server can communicate with each socket using protocol.py
protocol.py can send and "decrypt" messages from sockets
if you wanted to send a message from user1 to user2:
    user1 would give protocol.py user2's socket & message
    user2 will have their own instance of a thread on server_relay:
    this thread will recieve the message and deal with it 
        (as of 9 am 28/12 it will send message to everyone in selected chat_room (which user2 will be in))
    user2 would recieve a set of bytes and "decrypt" it using protocol.py

the "message bytes" being sent between the relay_server.py and client.py are not actually typed and readable messages
they contain 'instructions', which for most part would be a map, for example {"type" = "send", "message" = "Hello World"}
the type will tell the code its sending a message, and message will map to the message being sent.

As of now users can only be in one chat room at a time, users are forced to either join or create a chat room on start up
